## Description
Think back to that 3 R’s slogan (reduce, reuse, recycle). We’ve all been taught this since elementary school. When we were first taught this, it typically had to deal with plastics and paper. Many people don’t realize that recycling incorporates more than the typical plastics and includes textile recycling as well. Our solution to this issue is thrifting. One of thrifting’s biggest advantages for the planet is that it keeps clothes out of landfills. When clothes are thrown away, they sit in landfills for hundreds of years. Especially now that a lot of clothing is made out of synthetic material that won’t degrade, these clothes tossed into landfills take up a vast amount of space and contribute to the greenhouse gases plaguing our planet. Even clothes made out of organic materials won’t biodegrade properly in landfills and will produce methane gas. When people shop second-hand instead, they’re playing a great role in keeping clothes out of landfills. 

Shopping secondhand is not only incredibly sustainable but can also be prominently affordable. Buying from our online resale site means you can still buy the brands you like without supporting their unethical practices. Thrifting helps the planet by reducing the chemical pollution induced by creating and buying new clothes. Let’s think back to cotton, the production of cotton not only uses tons of water, but it’s also highly pesticide-intensive. This means that when cotton is produced and manufactured, it causes soil acidification and water contamination and this is from material that many people consider sustainable. 

As per a report in a fashion magazine, 73% of discarded clothes end up in landfills that are brimming with so much urban waste that by 2050, India will require one the size of New Delhi to fit all of the waste it produces. So, can you, and by any extension, your wardrobe, make a difference? Yes. Punarapi is an ethical brand working towards reusing, reacquiring, repossessing clothing, and making it your own.

So, what’re you waiting for? Switch to Punarapi and lower your carbon footprint!  

This is another one of those phrases we were taught young - carbon footprint. We often think that the only way we can do this is by biking to work instead of driving or by reducing our shower time. Though these are wonderful ways, thrifting is one of those steps to reducing our carbon footprint that doesn’t take much effort. All it asks is that you head to a thrift store rather than engage in fast-fashion shopping! We mention fast fashion because now more than ever, a ton of energy goes into clothing manufacturing. The whole process - transportation of raw materials to the production processes and shipping to stores - takes up a plethora of energy and time. When you buy second-hand, you’re preventing that massive waste of energy and resources on the production of new clothes. 

Punarapi is an easy way to make a difference in your own carbon footprint and take the small steps to lower the world’s as well. We’ve used cloud object storage from IBM and the model for image classification too has been implemented on IBM cloud.
